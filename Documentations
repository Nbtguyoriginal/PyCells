## Get Started

Ready to dive into the world of PyCells? Here's how:

1. Set up your OpenAI API key in the `config.py` file or as an environment variable.
2. Make sure the "memory" folders (`memory_files`, `memory_reference`, `subconscious`) exist.
3. Fire up PyCells by creating an instance of the `MemorySystem` class.

```python
# Example Usage:
from memory_system import MemorySystem

# Initialize the Memory System
memory_system = MemorySystem()

# Store a Memory
memory_system.store_memory("The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.", "landmarks")

# Retrieve a Memory
retrieved_memories = memory_system.retrieve_memory("landmarks")
print(retrieved_memories)

# Evolve a Memory
memory_system.evolve_memory("landmarks", "The Eiffel Tower is an iconic Parisian landmark.")

# Learn Passively
additional_info = memory_system.learn_passively("Tell me more about the Eiffel Tower.")
print(additional_info)
